# fe7_us

This is a disassembly/decompilation of "Fire Emblem" (US) for the GameBoy Advance, also referred to as "Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade" in modern official media.

It builds the following ROM:

* **[fe7_us.gba][no-intro]** `sha1: c735fdbb9e8abe19e0c6a44708df19acc962e204`

For now, this is primarily meant as a modding and research reference. [fireemblem8u][fireemblem8u] or [fe6][fe6] should be prioritized regarding actual exhaustive decompilation efforts.
